Anyone should be able to access all points of the website except the points for editing and adding components. The first page will be going to a search bar that will allow searches based on the restaurant name as well as location. Once submitted, the page will direct you to a search page with all the restaurants within your search. You can go into restaurants and find out the details about the restaurant. There will be a menu option that will allow you to find all the foods that are within the restaurant. 

## Entity-Relation Model
